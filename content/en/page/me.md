## Elevator pitch
My name is Mathieu and I'm a `insert title`. I enjoy searching for the whys and hows, trying to break them and making them better. I completed a [Bachelors of cybersecurity][1] at Polytechnique Montréal and would like you to benefit from it. I love reading and I love learning. New concepts, new skills, my interests cover a wide area from technology to health and wellness. I value freedom of thought and believe knowledge should also be free. I'm from Montréal and am open to work proposals. Would you like to know more?

## Education
The Bachelors of cybersecurity is obtained through accumulation of three undergraduate certificates, in my case it was [Cyber security][2] (3.82 GPA), [Cyber investigation][3](4.00 GPA) at Polytechnique and [Applied computer science][4](3.99 GPA) at Université de Montréal.

## General interests
When I'm not digging through documentation and news to stay ahead, I enjoy discovering craft breweries, cycling and working out. I'm more of a dog person and I'm also a member of [ΣΘΠ][5] since 2014.
