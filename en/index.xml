      <description>The story part I had been thinking about registering a domain for a custom email address. I was looking for an easy to remember name that would look professionnal without necessarily going for a common TLD such as .com. .ca, etc. Having a Google account and knowing thy offer a registrar service, I had a look. That&amp;rsquo;s how I came across the .dev TLD.
Marketing dept&amp;rsquo;s doing its job well so I clicked that attractive button.</description>
